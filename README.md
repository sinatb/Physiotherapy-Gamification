# Physiotherapy Gamification

## Description

This repository contains the source code and assets for my bachelor's degree final project at Shahid Beheshti University (SBU). The project focuses on gamifying physiotherapy exercises using Unity and Mediapipe to make rehabilitation engaging and accessible.

## Project Goal

The main goal of the project is to transform physiotherapy exercise's into fun and engaging activities that encourage users to participate consistently.

## Technologies Used

* Unity
* C#
* Google Mediapipe

The Games are built for `webgl` and are loaded into the frontend of the cubic project. Some of the event functions in the game (such as data updates from mediapipe) are called by next.js components. Also the project communicates with the cubic backend for updating user data such as User highscore.
